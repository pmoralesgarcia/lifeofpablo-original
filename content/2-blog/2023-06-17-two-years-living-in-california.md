Two Years. Two years since I left Nebraska. Two years since I moved to California. 


Ever since I've moved to California, I really started to get out of my comfort zone. You're probably thinking, "Pablo, don't you do that already?" Well, yes, I do. I'm the type of person who will honestly leave the country for extended periods of time and not think twice. I love adventure. I love visiting and trying new things in other places far from home. I'm a different person in these places. I can't really say that when I am in a place I consider home or at least when I was in Nebraska. 

Growing up, I always felt like I've always feared what others think of me and of my actions. I always felt like I was set to a higher standard.
