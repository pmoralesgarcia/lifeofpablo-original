Sleeping at the hotel in was one of the most comfortable places. Who knew old fashion was better? Breakfast wasnâ€™t what I was used to. It consisted of A slice of bread with cold cut (deli) meats. You cant forget a great cup of joe! What a simple breakfast? we made kolaches. Kolaches are a traditional food in the Czech Republic. They are formed like a cookie. We make a crater in the center to fill it with fillings. Fillings like apricot or cherry fillings. We also had cream cheese filling. Here is the result. tmp_23073-IMG_20140723_103515-737429513

 

Delicious right??

Then we went on a tour around Wilber. We learned the history and reasons people moved here. One was religious freedom. (Sound familiar?)

I got to play the bagpipes. It was odd but cool at the same time.

Then we learned how to dance polka and some waltz. It was fun. Now i can dance! (I was salsa dancing in Omaha yesterday.)   We had an amazing lunch that consisted of duck, dumplings, sourkrout, and a kolache for dessert. I tought it was best meal in a long time. Czech food is actually good and healthy. Richard Iâ€™m coming to the Czech Republic for more food. LOL ðŸ˜›

To end the stay in wilber Nebraska the local children entertained us by showing us traditional dances in traditional outfits. I think it is cool that these children are continuing their traditions.

Now Iâ€™m back in the dorms. Going to go get ice cream or something. Then Iâ€™ll go work out with my roommate and have some bro time.
