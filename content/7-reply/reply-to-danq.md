<p class="e-content">I really enjoyed your post. I’ve been thinking about doing little blurbs such as a few sentences or simply a photo with a caption or simple audio note. I’ve been getting away from mainstream social media as privacy is no longer an option. Your post has given me so many ideas, especially during travels where internet connection is weak or non-existence. </p>
